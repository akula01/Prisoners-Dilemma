# Prisoners-Dilemma
Genetic Algorithm for Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma

In iterated prisoner's dilemma, two players repeatedly play Prisoner’s dilemma. In this
game, opponent can be punished by non-cooperating for his defect in previous
rounds. We need to implement a strategy that can eventually reduce the payoffs
received over multiple runs. A player strategy predict the next move of the opponent. A
player can choose to cooperate, defect or move based on his opponent’s move or
even tit for tat/2tats.
